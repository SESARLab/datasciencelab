Title: Towards Responsible Data Science: Insights from EU-funded Research
Speakers: Francesca Pratesi (Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (ISTI - CNR))

Abstract: This seminar explores the ethical foundations shaping research practices, particularly within EU-funded projects. Focusing on Horizon 2020 initiatives such as SoBigData++ and TAILOR, we investigate the application of ethical principles within these projects. These projects not only advance specialized research but also aim to equip domain experts with the requisite knowledge and tools for ethical data and AI management.

The presentation provides insights into the objectives and methodologies of SoBigData++ and TAILOR, with a specific focus on their ethical dimensions. Emphasis is placed on the challenges encountered and the solutions developed to foster Trustworthy AI, ensuring that AI systems incorporate safeguards to make them reliable, safe, transparent, and respectful of privacy, while also adhering to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and FACT (Fairness, Accuracy, Confidentiality, and Transparency) principles. By examining these ethical considerations within these EU-funded projects, we aim to contribute to the discourse on responsible data science and its implications for future research endeavors.

*******************************************

The seminars Tales on Data Science and Big Data present and discuss the most recent challenges, emerging trends, and theoretical and practical research and development in the field of Data Science and Big Data. Seminars will cover basic and applied research, as well as industrial activities, pertaining to data, from data governance to data processing and analysis. Seminars will also cover research and development in related domains where data and data science technologies are key, such as distributed systems and architectures, cloud-edge continuum, high-performance computing, blockchain, statistics, security and privacy, assurance and certification.

The seminars are structured in three main tracks: academic, featuring renowned Italian and international scientists; industry, featuring speakers from industrial domains; and young, featuring researchers in early-stage careers.

The research seminars target the Italian and international research community at all levels, from PhD students to professors and researchers in both academia, industry, and public administration. Seminars are held in English, virtually, tentatively on a two-month basis.
