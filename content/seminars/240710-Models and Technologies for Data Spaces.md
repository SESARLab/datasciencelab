### Abstract

This seminar explores the ethical foundations shaping research practices, particularly within EU-funded projects. Focusing on Horizon 2020 initiatives such as SoBigData++ and TAILOR, we investigate the application of ethical principles within these projects. These projects not only advance specialized research but also aim to equip domain experts with the requisite knowledge and tools for ethical data and AI management. <br> The presentation provides insights into the objectives and methodologies of SoBigData++ and TAILOR, with a specific focus on their ethical dimensions. Emphasis is placed on the challenges encountered and the solutions developed to foster Trustworthy AI, ensuring that AI systems incorporate safeguards to make them reliable, safe, transparent, and respectful of privacy, while also adhering to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and FACT (Fairness, Accuracy, Confidentiality, and Transparency) principles. By examining these ethical considerations within these EU-funded projects, we aim to contribute to the discourse on responsible data science and its implications for future research endeavors.
